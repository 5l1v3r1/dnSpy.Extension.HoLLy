dnSpy.Extension.HoLLy
=====================

A dnSpy extension to aid reversing of obfuscated assemblies.

### Features
- **Change the displayed symbol name of types, methods, properties or fields, without modifying the binary.** These modified names are saved in an xml file, meaning you can write a tool to generate them automatically.
- Underline managed assemblies in the treeview.

### License
Because dnSpy is licensed under the GPL3 license, this plugin has to be as well. I like it as little as you do :(
